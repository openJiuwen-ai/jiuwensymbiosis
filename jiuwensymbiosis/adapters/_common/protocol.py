"""``RobotDriver`` Protocol — the contract a new vendor implements.

This is the smallest surface a per-vendor ``XxxLowLevel`` must expose for the
cross-vendor scaffolding (Env wrappers, ``_common.skills``, ``_common.vision``)
to bind onto it.

Structural typing (``typing.Protocol``, not a base class) is intentional:

* Adapters compose differently — some hold a single bespoke driver, others
  wire together independent submodules — so an abstract base class would
  force inheritance and lose composability.
* Pose / joint dataclasses are vendor-specific (4-DoF vs 6-DoF).
  A Protocol expresses "has these methods" without enforcing identical
  dataclass shapes.
* Most properties (camera, suction) are *optional* capabilities. Forcing
  every driver to implement them as ``raise NotImplementedError`` stubs
  bloats adapters. Instead, ``Env.capabilities`` advertises what's available
  and the consumer checks before calling.

Implementer contract:

  1. Construct: open SDK sockets, enable robot, snapshot init pose, load
     calibration, optionally start a camera.
  2. ``get_pose`` and ``home_pose`` return your own vendor Pose dataclass
     — e.g. ``4-DoF (x, y, z, r)`` or ``6-DoF (x, y, z, rx, ry, rz)``.
     The ``XxxEnv.get_observation()`` is what flattens to ``RobotObservation.pose``.
  3. ``move_to_pose_blocking`` speaks FLANGE frame. The api layer's
     ``goto_xyzr`` is responsible for tip↔flange conversion (so the same
     ``_common.skills`` works for any tool-offset).
  4. ``close()`` must be idempotent — it's called from ``Env.disconnect``
     which itself may be invoked twice on error paths.

Optional sibling protocol (``JointDriver``) covers joint-space access for
adapters that support it.
